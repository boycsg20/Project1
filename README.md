# Project1
Here will include all our videos, images, and process of completing the project. We began with our problem. Kyle wanted to be notified whenever his front door detached motion. To do this we needed a SIM 900A (or any other) GSM Module with SIM inserted which sends text messages and calls, however we did not have access to this GSM module, so we opted for a I2C LCD which just displays messages. Then we needed to find a sensor. We tried a PIR sensor, but it was not working properly so we switched our sensor to an ultrasonic sensor. With the ultrasonic sensor we could tell the distance of an object and therefore could code when the LCD could turn on. We only wanted it when someone was close to the sensor to send a message to whoever was opening the door. However, if we were to code it for our original issue, the distance of detection would be larger as to notify the homeowner for any movement outside. Our final project is a working prototype that displays a message “Welcome home” when an object is detached within 50 inches of the sensor, just enough to be triggered when the door is opened right in front of it.
